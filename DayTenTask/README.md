# CLEAN ARCHITECTURE WITH ASP.NET CORE

Clean Architecture is an approach that promotes modular, maintainable, and testable code. It emphasizes separation of concerns and dependency inversion, allowing for flexible and scalable application development. By adhering to clean architecture principles, developers can achieve better code organization, improved code reusability, and easier maintenance. ASP.NET Core provides a solid foundation for implementing clean architecture patterns, enabling developers to build robust and high-quality web applications.
